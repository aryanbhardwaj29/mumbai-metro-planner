# ðŸš‡ Mumbai Metro Navigator

This project is a simple yet practical **route planner for Mumbai Metro**.  
It helps commuters quickly find the **nearest station**, get the **shortest route** to their destination, and know the **estimated fare** before starting their journey.  

# ðŸ¤– What it does
- Finds the nearest metro station from your current location  
- Suggests the shortest route between two stations  
- Gives step-by-step travel instructions (which line to take, where to switch, etc.)  
- Estimates the total fare in INR  
- Can be run as a **Python script** or explored in a **Jupyter Notebook**  


# ðŸ“’ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Geopy** â†’ to work with user location  
- **NetworkX** â†’ to calculate shortest path between stations  
- **JSON** â†’ to store metro station data  

# ðŸ“‚ Project Layout

data/ â†’ contains metro_stations.json, which stores all metro station details like names, lines, coordinates, and fares.

notebooks/ â†’ includes metro_planner.ipynb for running and testing the project inside Jupyter Notebook.

src/ â†’ holds the main Python logic:

route_planner.py for shortest route and fare calculation,

nearest_station.py for finding the nearest metro station,

utils.py for helper functions like loading data and formatting results.


main.py â†’ entry point of the project, which integrates all functions and gives outputs.

requirements.txt â†’ lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

README.md â†’ documentation of the project.
