# ðŸš‡ Mumbai Metro Navigator

This project is a simple yet practical **route planner for Mumbai Metro**.  
It helps commuters quickly find the **nearest station**, get the **shortest route** to their destination, and know the **estimated fare** before starting their journey.  

# ðŸ¤– What it does
- Finds the nearest metro station from your current location  
- Suggests the shortest route between two stations  
- Gives step-by-step travel instructions (which line to take, where to switch, etc.)  
- Estimates the total fare in INR  
- Can be run as a **Python script** or explored in a **Jupyter Notebook**  


# ðŸ“’ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Geopy** â†’ to work with user location  
- **NetworkX** â†’ to calculate shortest path between stations  
- **JSON** â†’ to store metro station data
